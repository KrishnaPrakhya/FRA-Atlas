## 🏗️ **System Architecture Deep Dive** (15 minutes)

### **Slide 3: Technology Stack**

> "Let me walk you through our technology choices and why we made them."

**Frontend Architecture:**

```typescript
// Modern React with TypeScript for type safety
Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI
├── Server-Side Rendering for performance
├── Component-based architecture for reusability
├── Real-time updates via WebSockets
└── Progressive Web App capabilities
```

        self.risk_model = GradientBoostingRegressor()   # R² = 0.89
        self.similarity_engine = TFIDFVectorizer()      # Precedent matching

    def analyze_claim(self, claim_data):
        # Extract features
        features = self.engineer_features(claim_data)

        # Get recommendation
        decision = self.decision_model.predict_proba(features)

        # Assess risk
        risk_score = self.risk_model.predict(features)

        # Find similar cases
        similar_cases = self.find_precedents(claim_data)

        return {
            'recommendation': decision,
            'risk_assessment': risk_score,
            'precedent_cases': similar_cases,
