- This was causing white text on light backgrounds, making text invisible

#### **OCR Results Display**

- Fixed all text visibility issues in analytics section

### 3. **Color Scheme Standardization**

#### **Light Mode Text Colors:**

- Secondary text: `text-gray-600`
- Muted text: `text-gray-500`
- Labels: `text-gray-600`

#### **Dark Mode Text Colors:**

- Primary text: `text-white` or `text-foreground`
- Secondary text: `text-gray-300`
- Muted text: `text-gray-400`
- Labels: `text-gray-300`

### 4. **Enhanced Visual Elements**

#### **Cards and Containers:**

- Added proper borders: `border-gray-200/50 dark:border-gray-700/50`
- Enhanced backgrounds: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`
