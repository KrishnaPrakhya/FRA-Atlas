# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FRA Atlas application currently has several missing API routes and lacks multilingual OCR capabilities. This specification addresses the implementation of missing authentication routes, document processing routes, and integration of EasyOCR for multilingual optical character recognition with FastAPI best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Implement Missing Authentication Routes

**User Story:** As a user, I want complete authentication functionality including login, registration, and password reset, so that I can securely access the application with full account management capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users attempt to login THEN they SHALL be able to authenticate with email/password or phone/OTP
2. WHEN users register THEN they SHALL provide required information and receive verification
3. WHEN users forget passwords THEN they SHALL be able to reset them through email or SMS
4. WHEN users want to change passwords THEN they SHALL be able to do so securely
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN users SHALL receive clear error messages
6. IF users are already authenticated THEN they SHALL be redirected appropriately

### Requirement 2: Implement Missing API Routes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all necessary API endpoints to be implemented with proper error handling, so that the frontend can communicate effectively with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend requests user data THEN the API SHALL return properly formatted user information
2. WHEN claims are submitted THEN the API SHALL process and store them with validation
3. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the API SHALL handle file processing and storage
4. WHEN spatial data is requested THEN the API SHALL return GeoJSON formatted data
5. WHEN analytics are needed THEN the API SHALL provide aggregated statistics
6. IF API errors occur THEN they SHALL return standardized error responses with proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 3: Implement EasyOCR Integration for Multilingual Document Processing

**User Story:** As a user uploading documents in various Indian languages, I want the system to extract text accurately from my documents, so that the information can be processed automatically regardless of the language used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN EasyOCR SHALL extract text from images and PDFs
2. WHEN text extraction occurs THEN it SHALL support Hindi, English, and major Indian regional languages
3. WHEN OCR processing completes THEN extracted text SHALL be stored with confidence scores
4. WHEN text quality is poor THEN the system SHALL flag documents for manual review
5. WHEN multiple languages are detected THEN the system SHALL handle mixed-language documents
6. IF OCR processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and error handling

### Requirement 4: Implement FastAPI Backend with Best Practices

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust FastAPI backend following industry best practices, so that the API is performant, maintainable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL follow RESTful conventions and OpenAPI standards
2. WHEN requests are processed THEN they SHALL include proper validation using Pydantic models
3. WHEN responses are returned THEN they SHALL be consistently formatted with appropriate status codes
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with detailed logging
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN JWT tokens SHALL be validated properly
6. IF performance optimization is needed THEN the API SHALL implement caching and async processing

### Requirement 5: Implement Document Processing Pipeline

**User Story:** As an official processing claims, I want an automated document processing pipeline that extracts, validates, and structures information from uploaded documents, so that I can review claims efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN they SHALL be queued for processing in the background
2. WHEN OCR processing starts THEN the system SHALL update processing status in real-time
3. WHEN text is extracted THEN it SHALL be analyzed for relevant entities and information
4. WHEN processing completes THEN structured data SHALL be available for review
5. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL check for required information completeness
6. IF processing errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and reported to administrators

### Requirement 6: Implement File Management and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure and efficient file upload and management capabilities, so that I can submit required documents with confidence in their security and accessibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN they SHALL be validated for type, size, and security
2. WHEN files are stored THEN they SHALL be organized with proper naming and metadata
3. WHEN files are accessed THEN proper authorization SHALL be enforced
4. WHEN files are processed THEN original files SHALL be preserved alongside processed versions
5. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle cleanup and archiving
6. IF file corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and handle it appropriately

### Requirement 7: Implement Real-time Processing Status Updates

**User Story:** As a user who has uploaded documents, I want to see real-time updates on processing status, so that I know when my documents have been processed and can take next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing starts THEN users SHALL see real-time status updates
2. WHEN processing stages complete THEN progress indicators SHALL be updated
3. WHEN processing finishes THEN users SHALL be notified of completion
4. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN users SHALL be informed with actionable guidance
5. WHEN multiple documents are processed THEN each SHALL have individual status tracking
6. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN users SHALL receive estimated completion times

### Requirement 8: Implement API Security and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive API security measures including rate limiting and request validation, so that the system is protected from abuse and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be rate-limited based on user type and endpoint
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN JWT tokens SHALL be validated and refreshed properly
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN additional authorization checks SHALL be enforced
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement protective measures
5. WHEN API keys are used THEN they SHALL be managed securely with proper rotation
6. IF security violations occur THEN they SHALL be logged and trigger appropriate responses

### Requirement 9: Implement Comprehensive API Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want comprehensive and interactive documentation, so that I can understand and implement API integrations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL be automatically documented with OpenAPI/Swagger
2. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL include request/response examples and schemas
3. WHEN API changes are made THEN documentation SHALL be updated automatically
4. WHEN developers test endpoints THEN they SHALL be able to do so through interactive documentation
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN documentation SHALL include clear authentication examples
6. IF API versions change THEN documentation SHALL maintain version-specific information

### Requirement 10: Implement Background Job Processing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want resource-intensive tasks like OCR processing to be handled asynchronously, so that the API remains responsive and can handle multiple concurrent requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN heavy processing tasks are initiated THEN they SHALL be queued for background processing
2. WHEN background jobs run THEN they SHALL not block API response times
3. WHEN jobs complete THEN results SHALL be stored and users notified appropriately
4. WHEN jobs fail THEN they SHALL be retried with exponential backoff
5. WHEN system resources are limited THEN job processing SHALL be throttled appropriately
6. IF job queues become full THEN the system SHALL handle overflow gracefully
